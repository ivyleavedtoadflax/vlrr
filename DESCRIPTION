Title: Vectorised Implementation of Linear Regression with Simple Regularisation
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2015-08-13
Author: Matthew Upson
Maintainer: Matthew Upson <ivyleavedtoadflax@gmail.com>
Description: This small implements vectorised linear regression by
             optimisation, rather than the usual matrix factorisation in the
             standard \code{lm} function. In addition the package includes
             support for a basic regularisation algorithm.
