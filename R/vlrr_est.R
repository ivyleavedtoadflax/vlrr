#' @title Vectorised linear regression with regularisation
#'
#' @description \code{vlrr_est} Main function behind the vlrr package.
#'
#' @details Essential a wrapper function for the \code{optim} function..
#'
#' @param X Design matrix x.
#' @param y Vector of observations.
#' @param lambda Regularisation parameter.
#' @return Returns a list giving the original model call, the final gradient
#'   given by the last iteration of the \code{gradient} function call, and the
#'   final coefficients.

  # Compute covariance with sigma^2 * (X^{T}X)^-1. Note that Leisch (2009)
  # counsels against using this method of calculating the covariance matrix.
  # Instead he recommends using QR decomposition. As my present implementation
  # does not solve the normal equation (X^{T}X)^{âˆ’1}X^{T}y but instead relies on
  # optim I do not have the products of the QR decomposition to use in the
  # matrix inverse in the standrd lm implementation: vcov <- sigma2 *
  # chol2inv(qx$qr). It'll do for now... Note that this requires MASS::ginv().
  # Mildly faster to use crossprod than %*%
